truffle migrate --reset
npm start
```

Now connect your account by opening MetaMask(make sure you're on the right test network!).

## Gas Optimization Highlights

- Used uint8 for ratings, uint256 for core timestamps and prices
- Indexed events for lightweight log retrieval
- Minimized state writes in job update and review functions
- Avoided arrays for tracking applicants â€” used mapping(address => bool) to reduce gas per job

## Future Enhancements

- IPFS integration for resume and work proof storage
- Dispute resolution via decentralized arbitration
- DAO-based platform governance for moderation and curation
